Task 3 :

to resolve this problem, since my car  has infinite gas this means that i can make an exhaustive search method, for this i will do the folllowing :
- i will start in my current point i will call it A  and i will drive a distance   to East lets call this initial distance "d"
- i will come to my point A 
- i drive again the distance 2d  to the West, the other direction
- i com back to point A
- i drive to the Wast again but this time i will drive 4d 
- i com back to point A
- i drive again to East 8d 

i continue like this until i find my friend's car, using this method  the covered area increases exponnentially, which makes me able to find my fiend in  Finit time
